A starter template for a new Jekyll site using [Bookshop](https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop)

To run locally:
```bash
npm install
bundle install
npm start
```

This will serve the website on http://localhost:6060, where components can be browsed in the bookshop renderer at /components.

To help create a new component, run `npx @bookshop/gen --name biscuit`

This template should work out-of-the-box with live editing on CloudCannon.

For further help, see the [Bookshop Guides](https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop).
