A starter template for a new Jekyll site using [Bookshop](https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop)

To run locally:
```bash
npm i
bundle install
npm start
```

This will serve the website on http://localhost:6060, where components can be browsed in the bookshop component browser at /components.

To create a new component, run `npx @bookshop/init --component <name>`

This template should work out-of-the-box with live editing on CloudCannon.
